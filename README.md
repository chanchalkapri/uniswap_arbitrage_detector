### âœ… Final Checks
- [ ] `.gitignore` is working? (Run `git status` and see if `.env`, `venv/`, and `price_log.csv` are excluded)
- [ ] README.md added?
- [ ] GitHub repo is public (if you want to share it with recruiters)?
- [ ] Project pushed successfully?

Let me know if you'd like help writing your README or linking it to your LinkedIn portfolio!
